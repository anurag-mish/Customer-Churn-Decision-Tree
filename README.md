# Customer Churn Prediction – Decision Tree Classifier (CIS 412)

This project applies a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Developed as part of the Business Machine Learning course (CIS 412) at Arizona State University.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Seaborn / Matplotlib

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Loaded and explored the `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` dataset to understand churn patterns.
- Applied label encoding and handled missing values for model readiness.
- Trained a **Decision Tree Classifier** to predict churn based on contract, payment, and service-related features.
- Evaluated model accuracy and visualized decision tree structure.
- Interpreted key features influencing customer churn risk.
